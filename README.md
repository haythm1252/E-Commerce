SMALL NOTES

icant send the viewmodels to the service layer because the service in the application layer and application layer should not depend on the presentation layer
same with the uploadService it use iformfile and iwebhostenvironment and those cant be accessed in the application layer
and i can make another project for shared models and not use the iformfile but this is a littel complicated and i see this as a good and simple solution
